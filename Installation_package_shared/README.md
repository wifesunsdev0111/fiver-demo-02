Notes of Installation package:

- Buid folder: this is our app it is generated by calling npm build for each CIs. When using the installation package template, replace this folder with the one generated from each CI.

Chrome-portable:this is a portable version of Chromium browser. Note, that the version of Chrome is from before september 2021, and this is because the later versions interfere with NVDA screen readerâ€™s functionality.

node-portable: this is a portable version of Node.js, we need it to run server.js and our app.

Nvda-portable: a portable version of NVDA screen reader. It has a configuration file called default.dic where blacklisted words have been added.

server.js:
This is a server app that listens to port 4000 for API calls from our app, to write some user actions to googleAnalytics.json.
It also serves html from the build folder, where our app is.
It also launches Chromium browser in kiosk mode.

googleAnalytics.json: this is a json file where certain user actions are written to. Server.js writes them after getting API calls.

Launcher.bat:
this is an executable batch file that auto launches Screen reader, Chromium browser, adds node to PATH variable of the system, and our local server from server.js- -
Note, that the PATH variable address will have to be changed in the one where there installation package will be placed on the target computer.

- NOTE, for CMS-based apps, most the json file with assets will have to be inside build folder to work.
